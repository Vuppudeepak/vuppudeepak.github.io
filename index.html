    <p>India’s healthcare system, while vast, is often overburdened and uneven. We have a doctor-to-patient ratio of approximately 1:1500, significantly below the WHO’s recommended 1:1000. AI can help alleviate pressure on doctors by enhancing clinical decision-making, triaging patients, automating reporting, and improving diagnostics—making healthcare more accessible to every Indian.</p>

    <h3>Genetic Testing from Preserved Umbilical Cord</h3>
    <p>Deepak Vuppu co-authored a pioneering clinical study titled <em>"Massive parallel sequencing of dried umbilical cord remnants"</em>,
    published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics. The study highlights the feasibility of using dried umbilical cord remnants for
    postmortem genetic testing in cases of suspected monogenic disorders. This method provides families with closure and future reproductive
    planning options when traditional DNA sources are unavailable.</p>
